"""Deterministic cheap rejects - run BEFORE any AI spend.

Precision doctrine: a deterministic rule only drops a post when the drop is
near-certain. Whenever a genuine buyer phrase and a negative category both
appear (genuine buyers do say "we are hiring", "budget", "DM me if..."), the
post is kept for the classifier instead of cheap-dropped. Pure advice,
self-promo, job-seeker and recruiter content with NO buyer phrase is dropped
here for free.
