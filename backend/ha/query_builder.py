"""High-signal LinkedIn search queries built from the user's service text.

Weak queries are the single biggest lever on lead quality, so this module
spends real effort phrasing buyer language per lead type instead of dumping
the service word in one generic template. Every search always runs the whole
small base set together — a single narrow phrasing is never the only query —
and the engine later dips into `pool` to diversify when it is short of N.

GENERALIZATION RULE (§0): {service} is an opaque plain string. There is no
branching on what the service *is*, and no service name is baked anywhere —
the same templates must work unmodified for a plumber, a UX designer or a
wedding photographer, purely from the value passed in.

NEGATIVE PAIRING (§6): positive-only queries return garbage, so every query
pairs the buyer phrase with quoted negative seller terms the provider can
honor (LinkedIn supports -"phrase" exclusions). These are generic sell-side
phrases, deliberately not service-specific.
